# Tic-Tac-Toe Project with Vue.js

## Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed using Vue.js. It is my first time using this framework, and I decided to approach it differently than usual. I started with the help of ChatGPT to kick off the project, and then I delved deeper by reading the official Vue.js documentation.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main project files.
  - **components/**: Vue components.
  - **assets/**: Static files such as images and styles.
  - **App.vue**: Main application component.
  - **main.ts**: Application entry point.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: Main framework.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language used.
- **Bulma**: CSS framework for styling.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the project in action.
